## Threat Model

Before diving into the technical details, it's important to understand what CryFS protects against and its security boundaries.

<Row className="mt-4">
<Col lg="6" className="mb-4">

### What CryFS Protects Against

CryFS is designed to protect your data when stored on untrusted storage, such as cloud providers. It defends against:

- **Curious cloud providers**: Employees or systems at your cloud provider cannot read your files
- **Data breaches**: If hackers gain access to your cloud storage, they see only encrypted blocks
- **Metadata analysis**: Attackers cannot determine file sizes, names, types, permission bits, timestamps, or directory structure
- **Tampering**: Modifications to encrypted blocks are detected and rejected
- **Rollback attacks**: Attackers cannot replace files with older versions without detection

</Col>
<Col lg="6" className="mb-4">

### Security Boundaries

CryFS assumes your local machine is secure. It does not protect against:

- **Compromised local systems**: If malware has access to your mounted filesystem, it can read your files
- **Weak passwords**: Security depends on using a strong password for the configuration file (alternatively, you can store the configuration file locally using `--config` to remain secure even with a weak password)
- **Denial of service**: An attacker with access to your cloud storage could delete your encrypted blocks

</Row>

## Block-Based Storage
<Row className="align-items-center">
<Col md="4">
<Picture src={StoringDataImg} alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud." style={{maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", marginBottom: "20px"}} />
</Col>
<Col md="8">

### Why Block-Based?

Traditional file-based encryption (like EncFS or gocryptfs) creates one encrypted file for each of your files. This reveals information: an attacker can see how many files you have, how large each one is, and how they're organized into directories. This metadata can reveal <Link href="/comparison#metadata-encryption">a surprising amount about what you're storing</Link>.

CryFS takes a different approach. Instead of encrypting files individually, it splits all data into fixed-size blocks (typically 32KB). These blocks are then encrypted and stored with random IDs as filenames.

### How It Works

1. **File content** is split into same-size blocks
2. **Directory structure** is stored as additional encrypted blocks
3. **Metadata** (file names, sizes, timestamps) is stored in encrypted blocks
4. **A tree structure** connects the blocks, allowing CryFS to reconstruct your files

Crucially, all these block types—file content, directory entries, metadata, and tree structure—are encrypted identically and are completely indistinguishable from each other. An attacker cannot tell whether a block contains part of a file, a directory listing, or internal tree structure.

The result: an attacker with access to your cloud storage sees only a collection of identically-sized encrypted blocks with random names. They cannot determine:
- How many files you have
- The size of any individual file
- Your directory structure
- File names, types, or modification times

</Col>
</Row>

### Block Encryption

Each block is encrypted using an authenticated encryption cipher (default: XChaCha20-Poly1305). This provides:

- **Confidentiality**: The content cannot be read without the key
- **Integrity**: Any modification to a block is detected
- **Authentication**: Blocks can only be created by someone with the key

A unique encryption key is generated when you create a CryFS filesystem. This key is stored in the configuration file, protected by your password.

</section>

<section id="config-file">
<Container>

## Configuration File

When you create a CryFS filesystem, it generates a configuration file (typically named `cryfs.config`) in the base directory. This file contains everything CryFS needs to decrypt your data.

### Stored Information

The configuration file includes:
- **Cipher**: The encryption algorithm used (e.g., `xchacha20-poly1305`)
- **Encryption key**: The master key for encrypting all blocks
- **Root block ID**: The entry point to your encrypted filesystem
- **Filesystem ID**: A unique identifier for integrity verification

<Row className="align-items-center">
<Col md="8">

### Two-Layer Encryption

The configuration file itself is encrypted with two layers to ensure maximum security:

1. **Inner layer**: Encrypted with your chosen cipher and a key derived from your password
2. **Outer layer**: Encrypted with AES-256-GCM and a separate derived key

This dual encryption means:
- If you don't trust AES-256-GCM, you can choose another cipher for additional protection
- An attacker cannot even see which cipher you selected
- The cipher name cannot be tampered with to force a weaker algorithm

</Col>
<Col md="4">
<Picture src={ConfigfileEncryptionImg} alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers" style={{maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", marginBottom: "20px"}} />
</Col>
</Row>

### Key Derivation

Both encryption keys are derived from your password using [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt), a memory-hard key derivation function designed to be resistant to brute-force attacks. The scrypt parameters are stored (unencrypted) at the beginning of the configuration file so CryFS knows how to regenerate the keys.

### Security Recommendations

For maximum security, consider these options:

- **Use a strong password**: The security of your encrypted data depends on it
- **Keep config locally**: Use `--config /local/path` to store the configuration file outside your cloud storage
- **Verify cipher on mount**: The AES-256-GCM outer layer already protects against configuration tampering. If you don't trust AES-256-GCM, use `--cipher xchacha20-poly1305` to explicitly verify the cipher on each mount

<section id="integrity">
<Container>

## Integrity Protection

CryFS provides comprehensive integrity protection beyond just authenticated encryption of individual blocks.

### Version Tree

CryFS maintains a version tree that tracks the expected version of each block. This prevents:

- **Block rollback**: Replacing a block with an earlier valid version
- **Block deletion**: Removing blocks from the filesystem
- **Block reordering**: Rearranging the structure of your data

### How It Works

Each time a block is modified, its version number is incremented. CryFS stores these version numbers locally on your machine (not in the cloud), which allows it to detect if any block has been rolled back or if the version information itself has been tampered with.

When you mount your filesystem, CryFS verifies that all version numbers match what it expects. If there's a mismatch, the filesystem refuses to mount and alerts you to the tampering.

### Limitations

Integrity protection requires state to be maintained about what versions are expected. This state is stored on your local machine. If you access the filesystem from a new machine, CryFS will need to trust the current state of the cloud storage as a baseline for rollback detection. However, the authenticated encryption scheme still ensures that attackers cannot arbitrarily modify block contents—only rollback protection is affected when accessing from a new device.

## Security Analysis

The security of CryFS has been formally analyzed and proven using game-based security proofs.

### Academic Publications

- **Master's Thesis (2015)**: [CryFS: Design and Implementation of a Provably Secure Encrypted Cloud Filesystem](/cryfs_mathesis.pdf) - Contains detailed security definitions and proofs
- **DBSec 2017**: [A Novel Cryptographic Framework for Cloud File Systems and CryFS, a Provably-Secure Construction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23) ([PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/773.pdf)) - Peer-reviewed publication at the 31st Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy

### Proven Security Properties

The security analysis proves that CryFS achieves:

<Row className="mt-4">
<Col lg="6" className="mb-4">

**Confidentiality:**
- **IND-aCCFA security**: An adaptation of IND-CCA (indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks) to file systems, proving that encrypted data reveals nothing about the plaintext (except the total size of the whole file system)
- **File content**: Cannot be read without the key
- **File sizes**: Hidden by fixed-size blocks
- **Directory structure**: Indistinguishable from random data
- **Metadata**: File names, timestamps, and counts are encrypted

</Col>
<Col lg="6" className="mb-4">

**Integrity:**
- **Block integrity**: Modified blocks are detected and rejected
- **Rollback protection**: Old versions of blocks cannot be substituted
- **Structural integrity**: The filesystem structure cannot be tampered with

</Col>
</Row>

### Comparison with Other Tools

As far as we know, CryFS is the only cloud filesystem encryption tool with published, peer-reviewed security proofs. Other tools may be secure, but their security properties have not been formally analyzed and documented.
